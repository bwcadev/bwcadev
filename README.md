Hi, Iâ€™m Sam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science teacher based in the UK, looking to change careers to work full time as a programmer.

Despite spending the previous 5 years in the classroom as a teacher and head of department, I've worked on a variety of projects to keep my skills up-to-date.

I created a [blogging website](https://github.com/bwcadev/bwcanotes) using Next.js and Google Firebase, it allows users to post and comment using Google sign-in generated accounts with an added custom username.

[RetrievalApp](https://github.com/bwcadev/retrievalapp) is a multi-platform quizzing app built using Flutter, on the platform users can test their computer science knowledge by taking short quizzes.
This web app evolved from an [earlier project](https://bwca.dev/QuestionGenerator/) that I created for use in my classroom. The original project was built using the Vue framework and provides an endless bank of computer science questions for learners to answer.

My bachelor's degree is in Computer Games Technology, I have kept up this interest through building 3D web app games such as the [Untitled Car Game](bwca.dev/UntitledCarGame) using three.js library.
I have also used these skills to create an [interactive gallery](bwca.dev/PUA) for a digital artist using the react-three-fiber library. 

I'm an avid experimenter and often create things like this [Travelling Salesman simulator](https://bwca.dev/TravellingSalesman/), which was originally used to model difficult concepts such as computational thinking, intractable problems, heuristic techniques, and class inheritance to my college classes. 
One of my current experiments is trying to solve all of the Advent Of Code problems using a single JavaScript function, you can see my progress [here](https://github.com/bwcadev/AdventOfCode).
